In March 2020, during the first covid lockdown I decided to start and learn Python.
Therefore I used the following book:
Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition
A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming
by Eric Matthes

It's a nice course for python newbies. It starts at the super super basics and slowly builds up to really developing fun stuff
I finished the course until the end of the python basics. After that I only did the game design chapter.
The initial idea was to learn Python, to be ably to program an OPentrons OT-2 robot. I though game-developping came closest to that ;)

The two coolest creations I made while working through the Crash Course I put up here
-Penny the Hungry Cat 
In which you as Penny (Pennywise, my cat ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ ) have to catch as many food items as you can
-Snowglobe
Speaks for itself I guess. Does the exact same thing an actual snowglobe does, however you don't have to shake it everytime. 
It just continues for ever and ever ;)

enjoy!
