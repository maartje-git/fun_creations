Pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest 
number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the 
second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.

Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to 
add up all of those distances.
